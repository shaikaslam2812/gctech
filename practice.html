        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. The Hypertext defines the link between web pages, and Markup defines the text document within tags to structure the web pages.
        It is easy to learn and easy to use.
It is platform-independent.
Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.
Hypertext can be added to the text.
It is a markup language.
HTML uses predefined tags and elements that instruct the browser on how to display the content. HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. It’s important to remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.

This section will dive into the basic structure of an HTML page, which includes essential building-block elements like doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.

    <h3 id="REACT Js">react js</h3>
    <p>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[4][5] for building user interfaces based on components by Facebook Inc. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[6][7][8]

        React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.[9][10] A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements. It was first launched on 29 May 2013.[11]
        
        Notable features
        Declarative
        [12]React adheres to the declarative programming paradigm.[13]: 76  Developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.[14]
        
        Components
        React code is made of entities called components.[13]: 10–12  These components are modular and reusable.[13]: 70  React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its state.[15]
        
        The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components.[13]: 118 [16]: 10 
        
        Function components
        Function components are declared with a function (using JavaScript function syntax or an arrow function expression) that accepts a single "props" argument and returns JSX. From React v16.8 onwards, function components can use state with the useState Hook.
        
        React Hooks
        On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public, introducing React Hooks.[17] Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.[18] Notably, Hooks do not work inside classes — they let developers use more features of React without classes.[19]

    <h4 id="JAVA">java</h4>
    <p>
        Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.
